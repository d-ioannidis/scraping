A web scraper that extracts wanted data from a website by observing its HTML code, then saves it on a CSV file that is 
later displayed into two data visualizations as a pie and a bar chart. Used libraries are: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, 
Selenium, Re and Plotly. Example website used is: https://bestlifeonline.com/best-selling-novels/?nab=0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F

With this scraper, we extract the titles of the top 30 best-seller novels and the number of their sold copies, which are
later stored and used to visualize said data.
